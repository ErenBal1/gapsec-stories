        "murder_story_26_history": "This could be dangerous, but we have to take risks to get out of this place now. As I continued walking, I tripped on something and almost fell. When I picked up what I tripped on, I saw it was a staircase covered with stones! I slowly pushed the stones aside. The sounds increased a lot! I'm going down.",
        "murder_story_26_answer_1": "I'm waiting for news.",
        "murder_story_26_answer_2": "Don't forget your axe. You might need it.",

        "murder_story_28_answer_2": "Look for more information about the documents.",
        
        "murder_story_29_history": "Maybe I could find more information about this on the phone and computer, but neither of them is usable right now. I think I should examine the map now to see where I am and where I need to go.",

        "murder_story_29_answer_2": "Examine the map.",
        
        "murder_story_30_history": "I started examining the map. This... this looks like where I am. And there's a red mark. At a point very close to where I am right now. This can't be a coincidence, can it?",
        "murder_story_30_answer_1": "Try to go to the marked point.",
        "murder_story_30_answer_2": "Check the other items in the bag.",
        
        "murder_story_31_history": "Alright. Let me take a look at the other items. I'm trying to turn on the computer but it asks for a password. The phone is the same. But... wait a second, there's a small note in the inner pocket of the bag.",
        "murder_story_31_answer_1": "What does it say? Can you read it?",
        "murder_story_31_answer_2": "Could it be a clue for the password?",
        
        "murder_story_32_history": "Yes, something definitely died here, but if an animal had fallen, they wouldn't have covered it up like this, I think. Maybe they tried to cover up a murder. I think I'm right, because I see a shoe a little further ahead and I'm going right up to it. Yes! This is definitely a murder, because the shoe is covered in blood.",
        "murder_story_32_answer_1": "Get away from there using the map.",
        "murder_story_32_answer_2": "Can you go down into the well?",
        
        "murder_story_33_history": "I think the password is only 6 digits long and it's the same length as the pin code required for the computer. Let's see, is this the password? Yes, it opened! God, the battery is very low; what should I do?",
        "murder_story_33_answer_1": "Check the disks.",
        "murder_story_33_answer_2": "Look at all the files you can open.",
        
        "murder_story_34_history": "I'm trying, but the device is about to shut down. A file caught my eye; its name is 'remove.' There are pictures of people inside. And... the person here is me! How can this be?",
        "murder_story_34_answer_1": "Could this mean 'eliminate'?",
        "murder_story_34_answer_2": "Get out of there immediately!",
        
        "murder_story_35_history": "The map doesn't show anywhere I can go. Whatever is in this well might enlighten us. It doesn't look very deep; maybe I can use thick tree branches as support and go down. The smell is very heavy, so I have to wrap my t-shirt around my nose. I'm going down. There's a big, black bag here and there's a note taped on it; it just says 'Lucy'. This is my sister's name. Oh God, it can't be, it shouldn't be! I don't want to open the bag, this isn't real!",

I think this is a well and the marked point is showing exactly here. I approached the well and put the branch pieces aside. An incredible smell started coming to my nose; the smell of something rotten and I almost threw up. I barely managed to throw myself aside.",

        "gravehurst_story_33_answer_2": "I don't know kids, just don't panic.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_34_history": "How is this possible? The lights behind us started to turn on. Is this real or is it really the old phone at the reception we heard earlier ringing!?",
        "gravehurst_story_34_answer_1": "Edwin, this can't be real!",
        "gravehurst_story_34_answer_2": "What's this!",
        
        "gravehurst_story_35_history": "We're running there right away. I have important news, Professor. It was the phone ringing and it stopped when we arrived. The interesting thing is, there's not even a cable connected to the phone!",
        "gravehurst_story_35_answer_1": "You can't be serious ED!",
        "gravehurst_story_35_answer_2": "Something is trying to draw you to it.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_36_history": "Professor, you won't believe this because the dates show today. How is this possible? It talks about dark matter being tried to be contained but the plan backfired. The rest is too worn out to read.",
        "gravehurst_story_36_answer_1": "It seems like this substance caused everything.",
        "gravehurst_story_36_answer_2": "They must know our future.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_37_history": "The clues we've found so far indicate that, Professor. We continue to search the area for more clues.",
        "gravehurst_story_37_answer_1": "It's time for you to go down",
        "gravehurst_story_37_answer_2": "The file says the main event is in the basement.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_38_history": "Yes. Something is trying to play games with us. I'm starting to get scared, Professor! What should we do?",
        "gravehurst_story_38_answer_1": "The file says the main event is in the basement.",
        "gravehurst_story_38_answer_2": "Kids, I can't put you in danger. I'm getting scared.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_39_history": "We think so too, Professor. We're going down with the team. The edges of the walls are covered in moss. Even though the stairs have almost turned into ruins, we managed to go down successfully.",
        "gravehurst_story_39_answer_1": "You need to find the recording device mentioned in the file.",
        "gravehurst_story_39_answer_2": "There should be a recording device in the room where the experiments were conducted.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_40_history": "We agree with you, Professor. I'm sure that substance is down there. We've gone down.",
        "gravehurst_story_40_answer_1": "You need to find the recording device mentioned in the file.",
        "gravehurst_story_40_answer_2": "There should be a recording device in the room where the experiments were conducted.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_41_history": "Professor, there's a very heavy smell here. We don't see any rooms, just an iron wall and door ahead, just like in prisons. My team and I are trying to open the door.",
        "gravehurst_story_41_answer_1": "Were you able to break it?",
        "gravehurst_story_41_answer_2": "What's the latest situation, Edwin?",
        
        "gravehurst_story_42_history": "It took a long time, Professor. We finally opened it! Oh my god! This place is full of bodies hanging from the ceiling along the corridor. My team members started vomiting. God, how could no one find this place?",
        "gravehurst_story_42_answer_1": "This is truly unbelievable!",
        "gravehurst_story_42_answer_2": "Put on your masks immediately.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_43_history": "We've taken our precautions, Professor. We're moving forward. It's obvious that the corpses are the mental patients from the hospital. All of their hands are tied behind their backs, they have white gowns, and the same thing is written on all of them! (Don't look back)",
        "gravehurst_story_43_answer_1": "What do you see?",
        "gravehurst_story_43_answer_2": "Ed! Answer! What's happening?",
        
        "gravehurst_story_44_history": "Professor, I feel the blood flow in my veins stopping. When we read the writing and turned around, there was a mirror where the door behind us was. Professor! None of us have reflections in the mirror!!!",
        "gravehurst_story_44_answer_1": "Get out of there immediately! Mission aborted!",
        "gravehurst_story_44_answer_2": "How is this possible? Quickly check your surroundings.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_45_history": "We couldn't find a way out, Professor. We can't go back! Please help us!",
        "gravehurst_story_45_answer_1": "I can't call the police, Edwin. They'll put us all in jail.",
        "gravehurst_story_45_answer_2": "Glass?",
        
        "gravehurst_story_46_history": "We broke the mirror thinking the door might be behind it, Professor. There was no door but we found a note",
        "gravehurst_story_46_answer_1": "What does the note say?",
        "gravehurst_story_46_answer_2": "Read the note, Edwin!",
        
        "gravehurst_story_47_history": "(System: Signal lost.)",
        "gravehurst_story_47_answer_1": "Can't you see my messages?",
        "gravehurst_story_47_answer_2": "ED! Are you there?",
        
        "gravehurst_story_48_history": "Note: Don't look back invisible dead, look back and the mad will come alive!",
        "gravehurst_story_48_answer_1": "What does this mean? What's this now?",
        "gravehurst_story_48_answer_2": "Please tell me you didn't look EDD!!",
        
        "gravehurst_story_49_history": "Professor! We're hearing sounds from the ventilation! I think a gas is being released!",
        "gravehurst_story_49_answer_1": "Your masks!!!",
        "gravehurst_story_49_answer_2": "Don't breathe it in!",
        
        "gravehurst_story_50_history": "I think we have a problem, Professor. They-",
        "gravehurst_story_50_answer_1": "They what? What happened?",
        "gravehurst_story_50_answer_2": "Did they come alive?",
        
        "gravehurst_story_51_history": "No, there's nothing on the ceiling. All the bodies have disappeared.",
        "gravehurst_story_51_answer_1": "Is the problem with you?",
        "gravehurst_story_51_answer_2": "This is impossible!",
        
        "gravehurst_story_52_history": "Professor, I don't know if we're hallucinating but we're about to go crazy right now. I think this smell is some kind of gas and we're seeing these things because of it, I'm not sure. Professor, I think there's something in the corner. Yes, a camera and its light is flashing, it's looking right at us!",
        "gravehurst_story_52_answer_1": "So they knew from the beginning.",
        "gravehurst_story_52_answer_2": "I knew we weren't alone.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_53_history": "Professor, we examined the camera. There's an image watching us on the screen but the one watching is you! You're on the screen! It's as if you knew our every move long before. Professor, how is this possible? We can't quite make sense of it, but are you working with us here or against us? Are you behind all these experiments?",
        "gravehurst_story_53_answer_1": "It was nice to meet you.",
        "gravehurst_story_53_answer_2": "I'm sorry, kids.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_54_history": "We saw a dark shadow in a room, it suddenly disappeared. This might have something to do with the entity.",
        "gravehurst_story_54_answer_1": "Try to stay calm. Your eyes might be playing tricks on you.",
        "gravehurst_story_54_answer_2": "You're in danger Ed! Cancel the exploration.",
        
        "gravehurst_story_55_history": "We found an old notebook. It contains notes about some experiments conducted on the entity.",
        "gravehurst_story_55_answer_1": "We need to understand when the events related to the entity started.",
        "gravehurst_story_55_answer_2": "Are there any traps or points we should avoid mentioned in the notes?",
        
        "gravehurst_story_56_history": "There's no other information about this entity. I think it might be imaginary, but we'll still be careful. We'll collect and analyze the other clues we've found as well.",
        "gravehurst_story_56_answer_1": "Look for more information about the entity.",
        "gravehurst_story_56_answer_2": "Check the other rooms, there might be traces related to the entity.",

        "gravehurst_story_57_history": "The last entry in the diary mentions a 'dark entity' inside. No further details.",
        "gravehurst_story_57_answer_1": "A dark entity? Be prepared for danger.",
        "gravehurst_story_57_answer_2": "We don't know what the entity is, be careful.",

        "gravehurst_story_58_history": "Professor, the reception looks safe. There's a strange diary here, we're starting to read it.",
        "gravehurst_story_58_answer_1": "Quickly examine the diary. We don't want to waste time.",
        "gravehurst_story_58_answer_2": "The details in the diary could be dangerous. Be ready.",

        "gravehurst_story_59_history": "The diary says experiments were conducted to worsen the patients' mental states. A few patients mentioned hearing strange sounds.",
        "gravehurst_story_59_answer_1": "This information is important. I'm taking notes.",
        "gravehurst_story_59_answer_2": "Be careful of strange sounds. They could mislead you.",

        "gravehurst_story_60_history": "Professor, we've reached the reception. We found some old files and a key here.",
        "gravehurst_story_60_answer_1": "Keep the key. Quickly examine the files.",
        "gravehurst_story_60_answer_2": "If there's a map or plan in the files, forward it to me.",

        "gravehurst_story_61_history": "We found a map. It mentions a secret passage leading to the basement. The entrance point seems to be at the end of the corridor.",
        "gravehurst_story_61_answer_1": "Carefully examine the passage, but don't enter immediately.",
        "gravehurst_story_61_answer_2": "The basement could be dangerous. Be prepared.",

        "gravehurst_story_62_history": "We're hearing strange whispers, as if from far away. The team's morale is starting to drop.",
        "gravehurst_story_62_answer_1": "Keep your morale high, continue moving forward.",
        "gravehurst_story_62_answer_2": "Try to find the source of the whispers.",

        "gravehurst_story_63_history": "We're trying to reach the source of the whispers. The team is tightly bound together. The whispers seem to be focusing on a room at the end of the corridor. We'll be careful as we approach there.",
        "gravehurst_story_63_answer_1": "Are the whispers like human whispers?",
        "gravehurst_story_63_answer_2": "Can the whispers be understood?",

        "gravehurst_story_64_history": "More like a genderless hum. I think some words are being said. But we can't understand the sound because we're still far away. What should we do?",
        "gravehurst_story_64_answer_1": "Move towards the sound.",
        "gravehurst_story_64_answer_2": "That's enough. Go back.",

        "gravehurst_story_65_history": "Understood, Professor. We're approaching the room at the end of the corridor. But, wait a minute. There's something strange here. There's a large metal cover on the floor. It says 'Warning: Unauthorized Entry Prohibited'. There's also a military symbol.",
        "gravehurst_story_65_answer_1": "Interesting. A military entrance in a mental hospital?",
        "gravehurst_story_65_answer_2": "Can you open the cover?",

        "gravehurst_story_66_history": "Very interesting indeed, Professor. What do you want us to do?",
        "gravehurst_story_66_answer_1": "Can you analyze the cover?",
        "gravehurst_story_66_answer_2": "Can you open the cover?",

        "gravehurst_story_67_history": "We're trying, but it's a very heavy material. We'll try to force it a bit. Good, the cover is starting to open!",
        "gravehurst_story_67_answer_1": "What do you see?",
        "gravehurst_story_67_answer_2": "What's inside?",

        "gravehurst_story_68_history": "There's a metal ladder going down. It seems to go deep. And there's a faint hum coming from below.",
        "gravehurst_story_68_answer_1": "Be very careful.",
        "gravehurst_story_68_answer_2": "Check your necessary equipment before going down.",

        "gravehurst_story_69_history": "Alright, we're down. Wow! This is a massive underground military facility!",
        "gravehurst_story_69_answer_1": "What do you see?",
        "gravehurst_story_69_answer_2": "Describe in detail.",

        "gravehurst_story_70_history": "A large hall, computers and medical equipment everywhere. But these don't look like normal hospital equipment. They look much more advanced.\n\nThere's a large sign on the wall: 'Project DeVast - Limited Access'. Professor, what could this be?",
        "gravehurst_story_70_answer_1": "Project DeVast... This name rings a bell.",
        "gravehurst_story_70_answer_2": "It could be a secret military project. What else do you see around?",

        "gravehurst_story_71_history": "Professor, this is definitely a military facility. There are military symbols and equipment everywhere. The walls say 'Ministry of Defense Secret Project'.",
        "gravehurst_story_71_answer_1": "What else is there?",
        "gravehurst_story_71_answer_2": "These types of facilities are usually equipped with strict security measures.",

        "gravehurst_story_72_history": "Yes, we see security cameras and sensors everywhere. But most of them seem to be deactivated. Could the facility be abandoned?",
        "gravehurst_story_72_answer_1": "Possible, but stay alert.",
        "gravehurst_story_72_answer_2": "What kind of military equipment do you see?",

        "gravehurst_story_73_history": "Alright, Professor. What do you want us to do now?",
        "gravehurst_story_73_answer_1": "What's there militarily?",
        "gravehurst_story_73_answer_2": "Write down what's around you.",

        "gravehurst_story_74_history": "There are a few closed containers here. They say 'Caution: Biological Material' on them. Wow! We're seeing things that look like a series of high-tech weapon prototypes.",
        "gravehurst_story_74_answer_1": "Let's look inside.",
        "gravehurst_story_74_answer_2": "Stay away. Is there any document or computer?",

        "gravehurst_story_75_history": "Yes, we found a place that looks like a control room. There's an active computer inside.",
        "gravehurst_story_75_answer_1": "Take the computer and end the operation.",
        "gravehurst_story_75_answer_2": "Try to access it.",

        "gravehurst_story_76_history": "We've gained access to the computer. There's a file here called 'Operation DeVast'. I'm opening it.\n\nProfessor, something's happening! I think the facility is waking up!",
        "gravehurst_story_76_answer_1": "Quickly get important information from the Operation DeVast file.",
        "gravehurst_story_76_answer_2": "Get out of there immediately. The investigation is over.",

        "gravehurst_story_77_history": "Okay, we're scanning the file. This looks like a DARPA project. They've been working on advanced prosthetics and exoskeleton development. It was designed for the rehabilitation of injured soldiers. Apparently, Gravehurst Mental Hospital provided a perfect cover for this. The project was stopped 5 years ago. Due to budget cuts and ethical concerns. According to the last records, all equipment and data were safely transported and the facility was closed.",
        "gravehurst_story_77_answer_1": "So that's why the facility was closed.",
        "gravehurst_story_77_answer_2": "Again, due to the government's secret operations.",

        "gravehurst_story_78_history": "Yes, unfortunately. By the way, there's a creaking sound coming from afar, Professor. What should we do!?",
        "gravehurst_story_78_answer_1": "Do you remember the way out?",
        "gravehurst_story_78_answer_2": "Don't worry. It's probably an old ventilation grate.",

        "gravehurst_story_79_history": "Yes, that's what it was. I think it's just old generators and ventilation systems, Professor. Because the facility has been closed for a long time, these sounds might be coming out as the systems start working again.",
        "gravehurst_story_79_answer_1": "You need to get out of there.",
        "gravehurst_story_79_answer_2": "Move towards the exit.",

        "gravehurst_story_80_history": "Yes. We're leaving here. We're gathering a bit more information and photographing these before we leave. But they're not very clear due to the low light.",
        "gravehurst_story_80_answer_1": "No problem. Leave the place quietly.",
        "gravehurst_story_80_answer_2": "We're doing our best. Leave the facility.",

        "gravehurst_story_81_history": "We're moving towards the exit. There's a staircase here. Professor, we're hearing a sound now. It's like footsteps! It's coming from above!",
        "gravehurst_story_81_answer_1": "It must be a security guard.",
        "gravehurst_story_81_answer_2": "Stay calm. It could be a cat.",

        "gravehurst_story_82_history": "We're at the top of the stairs now. There are two people here. They're in civilian clothes.",
        "gravehurst_story_82_answer_1": "Attack them!",
        "gravehurst_story_82_answer_2": "Ask who they are.",

        "gravehurst_story_83_history": "Okay. I'll send you an audio recording while this is happening. Wait.\n\nTeam: Excuse us, who are you?\n\nUnknown Persons: We were about to ask you the same question. How did you get in here?\n\nTeam: We're a research team. And you?\n\nUnknown Persons: We're historians examining old military facilities. Do you have permission to enter here?",
        "gravehurst_story_83_answer_1": "Show your IDs and explain the situation.",
        "gravehurst_story_83_answer_2": "These aren't historians. Open fire!",

        "gravehurst_story_84_history": "Alright, Professor. They showed their IDs too. They really do look like historians.",
        "gravehurst_story_84_answer_1": "Tell them BRIEFLY what you saw.",
        "gravehurst_story_84_answer_2": "Tell them IN DETAIL what you saw.",

        "gravehurst_story_85_history": "Alright, Professor. I'm recording audio again.\n\nTeam: We found an old military research facility downstairs. There are some documents related to DARPA.\n\nHistorian: Yes, that's what we were after. We're here to document this facility. How much did you see down there?\n\nThe men are looking at me. What should I say, Professor?",
        "gravehurst_story_85_answer_1": "Give them general information.",
        "gravehurst_story_85_answer_2": "Tell them everything.",

        "gravehurst_story_86_history": "Okay. I'm recording audio again.\n\nTeam: We found some information about prosthetics and exoskeleton research. The project was shut down about 5 years ago.\n\nHistorian: This is very interesting. Would you consider sharing your findings with us?\n\nProfessor, what should we do? Should we share our findings?",
        "gravehurst_story_86_answer_1": "No. General information only.",
        "gravehurst_story_86_answer_2": "Yes, share.",

        "gravehurst_story_87_history": "[Audio Recording]\n\nTeam: Understood. Of course, we can share the general information with you. However, we need to present our detailed report to our own institution first.\n\nHistorian: We understand. So, what else did you see down there? Any interesting equipment or documents?\n\nTeam: We mostly saw empty rooms and old computers. We found a few documents, but most seemed like routine reports.\n\nHistorian: Interesting. We also know there are things similar to these. Do you know exactly what this facility was used for?",
        "gravehurst_story_87_answer_1": "Be careful, don't give too much information.",
        "gravehurst_story_87_answer_2": "Don't give detailed information about the documents.",

        "gravehurst_story_88_history": "[Audio Recording]\n\nTeam: We're not exactly sure. We saw that they were working on prosthetic technologies, but the details are unclear.\n\nHistorian: I see. Do you plan to do more research on this topic?\n\nProfessor, what should I say?",
        "gravehurst_story_88_answer_1": "Continue with general answers.",
        "gravehurst_story_88_answer_2": "Don't give a definite answer.",

        "gravehurst_story_89_history": "[Audio Recording]\n\nTeam: Our plans are uncertain for now. We'll evaluate our findings and then decide.\n\nHistorian: Alright, thank you. Maybe we can exchange information in the future. Here's my business card.\n\nTeam: Thank you. We'll contact you if needed.",
        "gravehurst_story_89_answer_1": "Now politely leave there.",
        "gravehurst_story_89_answer_2": "Leave the facility.",

        "gravehurst_story_90_history": "We found the entrance to the passage, but a cold wind is coming from inside. We don't know what's inside. The passage is deeper than we expected. We're checking our equipment before going down to the basement.",
        "gravehurst_story_90_answer_1": "Determine the depth of the passage. Check if there's anything abnormal.",
        "gravehurst_story_90_answer_2": "If your equipment is complete, enter the passage.",

        "gravehurst_story_91_history": "We entered the passage. We see scratches on the walls and old medical equipment. It's as if something was hidden here. There's a large metal door at the end of the passage. There are strange markings on it.",
        "gravehurst_story_91_answer_1": "Do the markings remind you of anything?",
        "gravehurst_story_91_answer_2": "Markings?",

        "gravehurst_story_92_history": "Yes, but the markings on the door are faint. We can only see that its color is red. It's not clear exactly what it is. The door is locked, we tried to force it but it didn't open. What should we do?",
        "gravehurst_story_92_answer_1": "There must be another mechanism around.",
        "gravehurst_story_92_answer_2": "Is there anything abnormal on the walls or floor?",

        "gravehurst_story_93_history": "Yes there is, Professor. Here, next to the door, there's a small panel. It has five colored buttons on it: red, blue, green, yellow, and white.",
        "gravehurst_story_93_answer_1": "Interesting. Is there any clue about these colors around?",
        "gravehurst_story_93_answer_2": "It could be some kind of code mechanism.",

        "gravehurst_story_94_history": "We checked the surroundings, Professor. There's a faint writing on the opposite wall. It says 'The secret of the rainbow must be solved'.",
        "gravehurst_story_94_answer_1": "Rainbow? Nonsense.",
        "gravehurst_story_94_answer_2": "The color order must be important.",

        "gravehurst_story_95_history": "Yes, Professor. There's a faint writing on the wall directly opposite us. It says 'The secret of the rainbow must be solved'.",
        "gravehurst_story_95_answer_1": "Rainbow? Nonsense.",
        "gravehurst_story_95_answer_2": "The color order must be important.",

        "gravehurst_story_96_history": "I think there's a mechanism related to the order of colors, Professor.",
        "gravehurst_story_96_answer_1": "I don't think so. Press a random button.",
        "gravehurst_story_96_answer_2": "First press the red one.",

        "gravehurst_story_97_history": "I think so, Professor. We'll press the buttons according to the color order in the rainbow. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple... But there's no orange and purple on the panel.",

        "zeta_story_102_answer_2": "How can this be possible?",
        "zeta_story_103_history": "Some things have always been here. You just couldn't notice. Maybe that's why they deleted your records. They made you forget who you are, what you did. Now the only thing you can do is accept.",
